# Introduction
BadUSB is a WiFi enabled physical USB Backdoor. Detected as a wireless HID keyboard, the BadUSB will not be detected as a malware of any kind on the host machine. Once plugged on a computer, it launches copies and launches a payload on the distant machine, allowing the ill-intentionned person to have a full R/W access on a terminal in the Host machine. Once pulled out of the machine, no traces of the hack will can be detected by the machine, as the communication happens locally. Meaning that the attacker cannot be identified once an attack is done, in opposition to the use of the couple Metasploit/Payload.
