#Access-Point/Web-Server
You'll find here code and documentation in order to flash the ESP8266 with our own custom software.
This software Turns the ESP8266 into a wifi access point on which a simple HTML UI will be displayed.
This small HTML interface will the allow to send malicious command to a computer thanks to a phone/PC connected to the ESP network while displaying the output of the commands previously sent.
#Prerequisite
In order to flash the ESP, you will need:<br>
1 x FTDI programmer such as https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716.<br>
1 x NodeMCU Flasher (see NodeMCU subfolder)
1x ESPlorer - http://esp8266.ru/esplorer/
That's it. Good luck flashing your ESP :).
